## Introduction

The R package `RAStestR` was designed to perform basic testing of RAS
sediment model outputs. The most common application is to verify that 
outputs of a particular unsteady or quasi-unsteady sediment transport 
model have not changed between RAS versions, but it can also be used
to compare the effects of converting a quasi-unsteady model to a 
fully-unsteady model, or to identify when (i.e. which version) a particular 
bug was introduced.

## Generating a RAStestR report

The function `generate_report` can be used to create reports from the 
sediment output data file. The general the workflow is:

 1. Create two copies of the project folder.
 2. Run the project in the first folder with the current or base version of HEC-RAS.
 3. Run the project in the second folder with the new version of HEC-RAS.
 4. Decide which output tables you want to analyze, and which stations, time stamps and/or grain size classes to analyze.
 5. Call `generate_report` from R and produce a pdf or html report.

## Use case 1: comparing RAS version outputs of a simple model 

Consider the quasi-unsteady model "Simple Sediment Transport Example" provided in the 
[HEC-RAS example projects download](http://www.hec.usace.army.mil/software/hec-ras/downloads.aspx).
Imagine that we want to verify that the outputs generated by HEC-RAS 
version *5.03* are the same as those generated by version *5.0*. First, 
we make two copies of the project folder and label them appropriately, e.g. 
*C:/example/RAS_50* and *C:/example/RAS_503*. Follow the steps below to generate a report.

### Run the models

First, start RAS 5.0 and run the model in the *RAS_50* folder, which 
will produce the output file *C:/example/RAS_50/MBex.p04.hdf*. Next, 
start RAS 5.03 and run the model in the *RAS_503* folder, which will 
produce the file *C:/example/RAS_503/MBex.p04.hdf*.

### Decide which tables to analyze

In most cases you will already have some idea of what tables you want 
to analyze, based on what functionality you are trying to test or if
you are trying to hunt down a specific bug. For this example, we will
choose to look at **Water Surface**, **Invert Elevation**, and
**Long. Cum Mass Change** outputs. Note that **Long. Cum Mass Change**
tables are produced for every grain size class; however, this example
specifies only one grain size class. We will look at all stations and
time stamps for the first two tables, but will restrict our 
investigation od the third table to total mass on *01JUL1975 23:45:36*.

### Generate the report

The R code below can be used to generate the report described in the 
previous section.

```
library(RAStestR)

base.file = "C:/example/RAS_50/MBex.p04.hdf"
base.label = "RAS 5.0"

new.file = "C:/example/RAS_503/MBex.p04.hdf"
new.label = "RAS 5.03"

tables = c("Water Surface", "Invert Elevation", "Long. Cum Mass Change")
sediment.options = list(which.times = "01JUL1975 23:45:36", which.grains = "")

generate_report(base.file, new.file, "quasi", "quasi", base.label, new.label,
  sediment.opts = sediment.options)
```

A few notes:

 - In the HDF output file, grain size classes are assigned numeric 
   indices, with the total mass table having no index. The table 
   "Long. Cum Mass Change" refers to the total longitudinal cumulative
   mass change, while e.g. "Long. Cum Mass Change 1" refers to the first
   grain size class. To generate a report using the total mass, we specify
   `which.grains = ""` in the `sediment.options` argument.
  - The table labels are not case sensitive, but they are punctuation sensitive.
    The table "Long. Cum Mass Change" is recognized, but "Long Cum Mass Change"
    is not.
  - Time stamps, stations and grain classes must be specified as character values.


## Use case 2: Sensitivity analysis of time step

Another common scenario is evaluating the impact of temporal 
discretization. This use case would proceed in the same manner
as the previous section, except that the user can simply create
a second plan in the HEC-RAS model rather than needing to copy
the entire project folder.

## Use case 3: Conversion from quasi-unsteady to fully-unsteady

The package can also be used to test differences in model output 
following a conversion from a quasi-unsteady model to a fully-unsteady 
model. The most important difference is that the user must ensure that
the output time series of the quasi-unsteady model and fully-unsteady
model match. Provided this is done, the comparison can proceed as in
the previous section, specifying a run type of "unsteady" or "quasi"
where appropriate.

## Other functionality

RAStestR can also be used interactively to import data from the sediment data file and
compute differences and RMSE. The two functions `read_standard` and `read_sediment` can 
be used to pull sediment data into R. The functions `diff_standard` and `diff_sediment`
are used to compute absolute differences in output values between two tables, and the 
function `rmse_table` can be used to compute RMSE. Table-sepcific helper functions are 
also provided to streamline the process by assuming certain input and output structures. 
For example, to generate the RMSE values for Water Surface at each station one can do:

```
d1 = read_water_surface(base.file, "quasi")
d2 = read_water_surface(new.file, "quasi")
d.diff = diff_water_surface(d1, d2)
rmse_water_surface(d.diff, "Station")
```
